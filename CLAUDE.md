# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new repository with no existing codebase. The project is currently in the initial setup phase with only a git repository initialized.

## Initial Development Setup

Since this is a fresh repository, the first steps would be:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Add basic configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Set up the initial project architecture
4. Add documentation as the project develops

## Git Repository

- Branch: `main` (no commits yet)
- Status: Clean working directory
- Remote: Not configured yet

## Notes

- This repository is currently empty except for git initialization
- No existing build system, dependencies, or architecture has been established
- Future updates to this file should include specific build commands, testing procedures, and architectural guidance once the project structure is defined
